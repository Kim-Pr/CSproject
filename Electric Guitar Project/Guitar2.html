<h3>
    <font color="#abbac1"> A Les Paul guitar is mainly used for the Hard Rock genre but I included Jazz because the artist that originally made this guitar was a Jazz guitarist and made it with the Jazz gnre in mind. It could serve as a beginnenrs guitar but,
        it might be little bit more difficult to play it correctly. Against traditional, semi-hollow guitars, typically used for jazz, a Les Paul is more comfortable and offers a warm, dark, rich tone and a vaersitile sound availability. For Hard Rock it offers low feedback,
    high sutain, and the same tones mentioned earlier, that not only make it ideal for Jazz but Hard rock as well.
